DEPLOYMENT CACHE ISSUE - EVIDENCE FOR REPLIT SUPPORT
====================================================

ISSUE: Deployment keeps failing with error about hardhat@3.0.10, 
but that version does NOT exist in the current package.json file.

CURRENT PACKAGE.JSON (VERIFIED CORRECT):
----------------------------------------
"hardhat": "^2.22.15"
"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox": "^5.0.0"
"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers": "^3.0.8"

File checksum: edb2c25f50ed9b9907d89a15a5560e22

DEPLOYMENT ERROR (REPORTING WRONG VERSIONS):
-------------------------------------------
Error claims:
- hardhat@3.0.10 (DOES NOT EXIST IN FILE)
- @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@6.1.0 (DOES NOT EXIST IN FILE)

VERIFIED INSTALLATION:
---------------------
Local npm list shows:
├── @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers@3.1.2
├── @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@5.0.0
└── hardhat@2.26.5

Production build: ✓ Compiled successfully in 17.1s

CONCLUSION:
----------
The deployment system is reading cached/stale package.json data.
The actual file has been fixed and builds successfully locally.
Need Replit to clear deployment cache or read fresh file content.
