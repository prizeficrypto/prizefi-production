1. Gambling Adjacency Signals (Even if It Is Not Gambling)

Your app is skill based, but reviewers still look for gambling-like signals.

Look out for and remove or soften:

• Jackpot language
• “Win big”
• Flashing reward animations
• Slot-machine style sounds
• Randomized payout messaging
• Celebration screens that feel casino-like

What to do instead:
• Emphasize ranking and placement
• Emphasize score and performance
• Use tournament language, not betting language
• Present rewards as prize distribution, not winnings

2. Prize Pool Transparency

Reviewers are sensitive to unclear prize logic.

Look out for:
• Prize pools that are not explained clearly
• Ambiguous payout calculations
• Hidden fee mechanics
• Unclear how many winners exist

Best practice:
• Clearly state prize pool size
• Clearly state number of rewarded ranks
• Clearly explain how rewards are split
• Avoid dynamic or opaque calculations

Even if the math is fair, opacity can trigger concern.

3. Progression and Grinding Mechanics

Be careful that progression does not feel like:

• Pay more to improve odds
• Pay repeatedly to climb rankings quickly
• Endless paid loops

Things to check:
• Are users encouraged to rejoin immediately after finishing?
• Is there urgency pressure to keep paying?
• Are there streaks or bonuses tied to repeated paid entry?

Safer approach:
• Clear tournament windows
• Natural stopping points
• Emphasis on skill improvement through practice, not payment

4. Dark Pattern Avoidance

World App reviewers look for consumer protection issues.

Check for:
• Confusing button placement
• Accidental taps that cause payment
• Auto-starting paid flows
• Payment confirmation screens that are too subtle

Best practice:
• Clear confirmation before charging WLD
• Explicit cost displayed before join
• No surprise charges

5. Minor Protection and Abuse Signals

Even though World App handles verification, your app still needs guardrails.

Check for:
• Bot-like behavior patterns
• Very fast repeated joins
• Suspicious session abandon loops

You do not need to solve fraud, but showing awareness helps.

6. Accessibility and Clarity

Accessibility issues rarely cause rejection alone, but they stack.

Look out for:
• Color-only instructions
• Small text in critical screens
• Fast transitions without explanation

Especially for a reaction game:
• Give a clear start signal
• Ensure consistent timing
• Avoid confusing transitions

7. Submission Description Consistency

Make sure:
• Your submission description exactly matches the app behavior
• You do not over-promise or oversimplify
• You explicitly state “no paid retries”

Inconsistency between description and behavior is a quiet rejection reason.

8. Emotional Framing

This one is subtle.

Avoid framing like:
• “Don’t miss out”
• “Last chance”
• “Only the best win money”

Prefer:
• “Top performers are rewarded”
• “Ranking is based on final match score”

The emotional tone matters more than most people expect.

9. Reviewer Mental Model Test (Use This)

Before resubmitting, ask one simple question:

Could a reviewer explain my app in one sentence without using the words chance, retry, or bet?

If yes, you are safe.
If no, fix the framing.

10. Document Everything Once

One last practical tip.

Include a short “How competition works” screen inside the app.

Not for users. For reviewers.

Reviewers do open rules screens sometimes.
Make it boring, factual, and clear.
